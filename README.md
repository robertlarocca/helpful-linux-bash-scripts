# helpful-linux-bash-scripts

Helpful Linux bash_aliases and scripts for sysadmins, developers and the forgetful.

The `clean.sh` script previously [clean-command-history](https://github.com/robertlarocca/clean-command-history) is now part of this repository. Less for me to maintain and just makes sense. It's a "helpful" Linux bash script. ðŸ™‚
